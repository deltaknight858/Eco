# Workflows Overview

Eco workflows define the standardized processes for contribution, development, and operation within the ecosystem.

## Core Workflow Types

### Development Workflows
- Code contribution process
- Feature development lifecycle
- Testing and validation procedures
- Deployment and release management

### Operational Workflows
- Agent coordination patterns
- Resource management procedures
- Monitoring and alerting flows
- Incident response protocols

### Provenance Workflows
- [Provenance Cycle](./provenance-cycle.mdx) - Core integrity process
- [Contributor Flow](./contributor-flow.mdx) - Development contribution process

## Workflow Characteristics

- **Automated**: Minimal manual intervention required
- **Traceable**: Full provenance chain maintained
- **Validated**: Quality gates at each stage
- **Collaborative**: Multi-agent coordination when needed
