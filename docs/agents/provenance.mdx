# Provenance Agent

The Provenance Agent ensures cryptographic integrity and traceability of all operations within the Eco ecosystem.

## Core Functions

- **Operation Tracking**: Records all agent activities and transformations
- **Cryptographic Sealing**: Applies cryptographic signatures to completed work
- **Chain Validation**: Verifies the integrity of the provenance chain
- **Audit Trail**: Maintains immutable records of all system operations

## Provenance Seal

Every completed operation receives a provenance seal containing:
- Timestamp of operation
- Agent signatures involved
- Input/output hashes
- Validation checksums
- Chain linkage to previous operations
