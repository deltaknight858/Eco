# Documentation Protocol for the Oursynth Ecosystem

## 1. Preamble

This document outlines the protocol for documenting all changes to the Oursynth Ecosystem. The purpose of this protocol is to ensure that every modification is meticulously recorded, providing a clear, traceable, and insightful history of the project's evolution. Adherence to this protocol is mandatory for all future changes.

## 2. The Documentation Ledger

For each discrete change or addition, a new entry must be created in a master change log. Each entry will be a comprehensive record, structured according to the following fields. This is the list of things we will count, record, and analyze for every change.

### 2.1. Core Change Metrics

These fields provide the fundamental, quantitative data about the change.

-   **`Change-ID`**: A unique identifier for the change (e.g., `YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS-GEMINI`).
-   **`Timestamp`**: The ISO 8601 timestamp of when the change was committed.
-   **`Author`**: The entity making the change (e.g., "Gemini", "Co-Pilot", "Human Operator").
-   **`File-Operations-Count`**: An integer count of all files created, modified, or deleted.
-   **`Lines-of-Code-Altered`**: An integer representing the net change in lines of code (added + deleted).
-   **`Schema-Version-Impact`**: A list of any schema files whose version should be bumped as a result of the change.

### 2.2. Semantic and Contextual Fields

These fields provide the qualitative "why" and "what" behind the change.

-   **`Rationale`**: A clear, concise explanation of why the change was necessary. This must connect the change to a higher-level goal, a user request, or a previously identified gap (e.g., "To implement the R3 cycle as per the Evolutionary Mandate").
-   **`High-Level-Summary`**: An executive summary of the change, written in plain language. What was accomplished?
-   **`Affected-Components`**: A list of the primary components, agents, or systems affected by the change (e.g., `Conductor`, `Agent-X`, `Quality-Gates`).

### 2.3. Technical Implementation Details

This section provides the specific technical footprint of the change.

-   **`Affected-File-Paths`**: A complete list of the absolute paths of all files that were touched.
-   **`Change-Diff`**: A summary of the diff for each modified file. For new files, this will be noted as "File Created". For deletions, "File Deleted". This should be detailed enough to understand the precise nature of the modification without necessarily needing to read the entire file.

### 2.4. Evolutionary and Strategic Impact

This section connects the change to the grander vision of the Oursynth Ecosystem.

-   **`Evolutionary-Mandate-Alignment`**: How does this change align with or advance the principles laid out in the `Conductor-Evolutionary-Mandate.md`? (e.g., "Introduces the `refine` task, enabling Phase 2 of the R3 cycle.")
-   **`Pathway-Contribution`**: (Forward-looking) How does this change serve as a stepping stone towards the future concept of "Pathways"? Does it build a necessary foundation or component?
-   **`Second-Order-Effects`**: A speculative analysis of potential unintended consequences, both positive and negative. What might happen as a result of this change that we haven't explicitly planned for?
-   **`Future-Opportunities`**: What new capabilities, features, or avenues of research does this change unlock? This is for "outside the box" thinking.

## 3. Protocol in Practice

For every subsequent interaction that results in a modification to the codebase or specifications, I will generate a report conforming to this protocol. This report will be my primary output, serving as the definitive record of the change. The journey is now the journal.
