# Contributor First Hour

Welcome to your first 60 minutes inside **Eco**.  
This guide ensures you can clone, run, and contribute with provenance from the very start.

---

## ⏱️ 0–10 min: Setup

- Clone the repo:
  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/oursynth/eco.git
  cd eco
  ```

- Install dependencies:
  ```bash
  pnpm install
  ```

- Start the Shell:
  ```bash
  pnpm dev --filter @eco/shell
  ```

<ProvenanceNote>
Your very first pnpm install is provenance‑stamped by the lockfile. Every contributor shares the same dependency graph.
</ProvenanceNote>

## ⏱️ 10–20 min: Explore the Shell

- Open `http://localhost:3000`
- Navigate through the Eco‑Shell
- Notice the Provenance Footer in gold — every page is sealed.

<ProvenanceNote>
The Shell is the cinematic frame. Every app, capsule, and doc lives inside it.
</ProvenanceNote>

## ⏱️ 20–40 min: Open the Docs

- Run the Docs app:
  ```bash
  pnpm dev --filter @eco/docs
  ```

- Visit `http://localhost:3001`
- Explore the Docs Index Power Page
- Click through Guides, Architecture, Agents.

<ProvenanceNote>
Docs are Power Pages too. Every .mdx file is provenance‑aware.
</ProvenanceNote>

## ⏱️ 40–55 min: Make Your First Change

- Edit `docs/guides/getting-started.mdx`
- Add a line under "Getting Started"
- Commit with provenance:
  ```bash
  git add docs/guides/getting-started.mdx
  git commit -m "docs: personalize getting started guide"
  git push origin main
  ```

<ProvenanceNote>
Every commit is a provenance seal. Your first contribution is now part of Eco's history.
