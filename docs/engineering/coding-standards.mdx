# Coding Standards

Eco maintains high code quality through standardized practices and automated tooling.

## General Principles

- **Consistency**: Uniform style across the entire codebase
- **Clarity**: Code should be self-documenting and easy to understand
- **Maintainability**: Write code that's easy to modify and extend
- **Performance**: Consider performance implications of design decisions

## TypeScript Standards

- Use strict TypeScript configuration
- Prefer explicit types over `any`
- Utilize union types and type guards effectively
- Document complex type definitions

## React/Next.js Standards

- Use functional components with hooks
- Implement proper error boundaries
- Follow Next.js App Router conventions
- Optimize for Core Web Vitals

## Styling Standards

- Use Tailwind CSS for utility-first styling
- Leverage core tokens for consistent design
- Implement responsive design by default
- Use semantic class names for complex components

## Testing Standards

- Write unit tests for all business logic
- Implement integration tests for critical flows
- Use React Testing Library for component tests
- Maintain minimum 80% code coverage
