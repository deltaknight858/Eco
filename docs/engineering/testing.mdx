# Testing Strategy

Comprehensive testing ensures reliability and maintainability across the Eco ecosystem.

## Testing Pyramid

### Unit Tests
- Test individual functions and components in isolation
- Use Jest and React Testing Library
- Mock external dependencies
- Focus on business logic and edge cases

### Integration Tests
- Test component interactions and data flow
- Validate API integrations
- Test agent coordination through Orchestrator
- Verify provenance chain integrity

### End-to-End Tests
- Test complete user workflows
- Validate cross-capsule functionality
- Ensure proper Shell integration
- Test deployment and production scenarios

## Testing Tools

- **Jest**: JavaScript testing framework
- **React Testing Library**: Component testing utilities
- **Playwright**: End-to-end testing
- **MSW**: API mocking for tests

## Best Practices

- Write tests before or alongside implementation
- Maintain clear test descriptions and organization
- Use descriptive assertions and error messages
- Test both happy paths and error scenarios
- Keep tests fast and deterministic
