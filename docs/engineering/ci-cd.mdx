# CI/CD Pipeline

Automated continuous integration and deployment ensures code quality and reliable releases.

## Continuous Integration

### Code Quality Checks
- TypeScript compilation
- ESLint and Prettier formatting
- Unit and integration tests
- Security vulnerability scanning

### Build Validation
- Multi-environment builds (development, staging, production)
- Bundle size analysis
- Performance regression testing
- Cross-browser compatibility checks

## Continuous Deployment

### Staging Deployment
- Automatic deployment to staging environment
- Integration test execution
- Performance monitoring
- User acceptance testing preparation

### Production Deployment
- Manual approval gates for production releases
- Blue-green deployment strategy
- Rollback capabilities
- Post-deployment monitoring and alerting

## Pipeline Stages

1. **Source Control**: Code committed to repository
2. **Build**: Compile and package applications
3. **Test**: Execute comprehensive test suite
4. **Security**: Vulnerability and compliance scanning
5. **Deploy**: Automated deployment to target environments
6. **Monitor**: Post-deployment health checks and monitoring

## Tools and Technologies

- GitHub Actions for pipeline orchestration
- Turbo for build optimization
- Docker for containerization
- Azure for cloud infrastructure
