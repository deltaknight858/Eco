# Design Language

Eco's design language emphasizes **cinematic interfaces** with a focus on provenance, transparency, and futuristic aesthetics.

## Core Principles

### Cinematic Experience
- Glass surfaces with subtle transparency
- Neon glow effects for interactive elements
- Smooth animations and transitions
- Immersive dark theme optimized for extended use

### Provenance Awareness
- Visual indicators of data lineage and authenticity
- Cryptographic seals displayed prominently
- Timestamp and authorship information integrated into design
- Trust indicators through visual cues

### Modular Architecture
- Power Pages as self-contained interface capsules
- Consistent navigation and branding across modules
- Seamless transitions between different application areas
- Unified design system across all components

## Visual Hierarchy

1. **Primary Actions**: Cyan glow with high contrast
2. **Navigation**: Violet accents with clear structure
3. **Content Areas**: Glass panels with subtle borders
4. **Interactive Elements**: Magenta highlights on hover/focus
5. **Metadata**: Muted text with monospace font for technical details
