# üí≠ DISCUSSION BOARD: ARCHITECTURAL PROPOSALS & OPEN QUESTIONS

## Purpose

This document serves as a living discussion space for architectural decisions, alternative approaches, and open questions about the OurSynth platform. Think of it as the engineering team's whiteboard where we debate trade-offs before committing to implementations.

## üèõÔ∏è CORE ARCHITECTURAL DECISIONS

### **PROPOSAL 1: Memory-First vs. Feature-First Development**

#### **Current Approach (Memory-First)**

**Rationale:**
- Memory is the substrate‚Äîeverything else is a specialization of memory
- Build the foundation once, correctly, then everything inherits it
- Semantic search and provenance become "free" for all features
- Natural convergence toward unified architecture

**Trade-offs:**
- ‚úÖ **Pros:**
  - Single source of truth for all data
  - Cross-domain queries become trivial ("show all deployments from this conversation")
  - Time-travel and replay built into the substrate
  - AI agents have complete context by default
  
- ‚ùå **Cons:**
  - Longer time-to-first-feature (can't ship notes until memory graph works)
  - Higher initial complexity (graph database, embeddings, edges)
  - Team must understand graph thinking from day 1
  - Risk of over-engineering if memory abstraction is wrong

#### **Alternative Approach (Feature-First)**

**Rationale:**
- Ship notes app in Week 1, deploy dashboard in Week 2, etc.
- Prove value quickly with simple implementations
- Refactor to shared memory layer later
- Classic MVP mentality

**Trade-offs:**
- ‚úÖ **Pros:**
  - Faster time-to-first-demo
  - Team can work in parallel on isolated features
  - Easier to pivot if market feedback changes direction
  - Lower cognitive load initially
  
- ‚ùå **Cons:**
  - Retrofit pain: moving existing notes into memory graph later is hard
  - Duplicated logic: each feature implements its own search, storage, etc.
  - Cross-domain features require massive refactoring
  - AI agents can't access unified context

#### **üí¨ Open for Discussion:**

**Question:** Is the memory-first approach too ambitious for MVP? Should we start with a simple notes app and prove value before building the grand unified architecture?

**My Take (AI):** Memory-first is the right call *if* we're building for the 5-year vision, not the 5-week demo. If the goal is "build something people will use for a decade," invest in the foundation. If it's "get funded by showing traction," ship features fast and refactor later.

### **PROPOSAL 2: Provenance as Middleware vs. Provenance as Opt-In**

#### **Current Approach (Provenance as Middleware)**

**Rationale:**
- Every mutation automatically gets provenance stamp
- Users don't think about it‚Äîit just happens
- Cryptographic trust by default
- Can't create entities without provenance

**Implementation:**
```typescript
// Every service method goes through provenance interceptor
class ProvenanceMiddleware {
  beforeCreate(entity) {
    return {
      ...entity,
      provenance: this.generateStamp(entity)
    };
  }
}
```

**Trade-offs:**
- ‚úÖ **Pros:**
  - Zero-trust by default
  - Can't forget to stamp something
  - Marketplace trust is automatic
  - Audit trail complete and tamper-proof
  
- ‚ùå **Cons:**
  - Performance overhead on every write
  - Complexity for contributors (can't just insert into DB)
  - Requires Ed25519 key management from day 1
  - Harder to debug (provenance failures block all writes)

#### **Alternative Approach (Opt-In Provenance)**

**Rationale:**
- Provenance is a premium feature
- Users explicitly "verify" artifacts when ready
- Start simple (no signing), add trust later
- Classic progressive enhancement

**Implementation:**
```typescript
// Users call provenance service when they want it
await provenanceService.stamp(capsuleId, 'gold');
```

**Trade-offs:**
- ‚úÖ **Pros:**
  - Simpler initial implementation
  - Users understand what provenance means (they clicked "verify")
  - No performance overhead for casual usage
  - Easier to debug (provenance is a separate concern)
  
- ‚ùå **Cons:**
  - Users can create unverified artifacts (trust issues in marketplace)
  - Audit trail has gaps (not everything is stamped)
  - Retrofitting existing entities is painful
  - Can't guarantee lineage for everything

#### **üí¨ Open for Discussion:**

**Question:** Should provenance be automatic (middleware) or explicit (opt-in)? Is there a hybrid approach?

**My Take (AI):** I propose a **hybrid model**:
- Bronze tier is automatic (created timestamp + basic metadata)
- Silver tier is opt-in (user clicks "sign" ‚Üí Ed25519 signature)
- Gold tier requires verification workflow (SBOM + tests + signature)

This way, everything has *some* provenance (bronze), but users consciously upgrade to higher trust tiers. Best of both worlds?

### **PROPOSAL 3: Real-Time Streaming Architecture**

#### **Current Approach (WebSocket + Redis Pub/Sub)**

**Rationale:**
- WebSocket server broadcasts conductor events
- Redis pub/sub enables horizontal scaling
- Clients subscribe to event streams filtered by type/agent/tier
- Replay buffer (last 100 events) for new connections

**Architecture:**
```
Client (React) 
  ‚Üì WebSocket
AgentStreamService 
  ‚Üì Redis Pub/Sub
Conductor (Event Bus)
  ‚Üë
Agents (Memory, Codegen, Verification)
```

**Trade-offs:**
- ‚úÖ **Pros:**
  - True real-time updates (< 100ms latency)
  - Scales horizontally (add more WebSocket servers)
  - Replay buffer enables late-joiners to catch up
  - Industry-standard pattern (proven at scale)
  
- ‚ùå **Cons:**
  - Infrastructure complexity (Redis, WebSocket server)
  - Harder to debug (events are ephemeral)
  - Mobile/flaky connections need reconnection logic
  - Cost of Redis hosting

#### **Alternative 1: Server-Sent Events (SSE)**

**Rationale:**
- Simpler than WebSocket (HTTP-based)
- Built-in reconnection logic
- No need for Redis (can use in-memory event buffer)
- Works everywhere (HTTP proxy-friendly)

**Trade-offs:**
- ‚úÖ **Pros:** Simpler, built-in browser support, HTTP-based
- ‚ùå **Cons:** One-way only (client can't send to server), less efficient

#### **Alternative 2: Polling (No Streaming)**

**Rationale:**
- Client polls `/api/events?since=timestamp` every 5 seconds
- Dead simple, no special infrastructure
- Works on any hosting platform

**Trade-offs:**
- ‚úÖ **Pros:** Zero infrastructure, trivial to implement, works everywhere
- ‚ùå **Cons:** High latency (5s), inefficient, not "real-time"

#### **Alternative 3: GraphQL Subscriptions**

**Rationale:**
- If we're using GraphQL already, use built-in subscriptions
- Type-safe event schemas
- Playground for testing subscriptions

**Trade-offs:**
- ‚úÖ **Pros:** Type-safe, integrated with GraphQL
- ‚ùå **Cons:** Requires GraphQL (do we want that dependency?)

#### **üí¨ Open for Discussion:**

**Question:** Is WebSocket + Redis overkill for MVP? Should we start with SSE or even polling, then upgrade to WebSocket when we have scale issues?

**My Take (AI):** Start with **SSE** for MVP. It's 90% as good as WebSocket for one-way streaming (agent ‚Üí UI), way simpler to implement, and we can always upgrade to WebSocket later if we need bidirectional or sub-100ms latency.

Redis is the real question. If we're deploying to Vercel/Netlify, we can't use Redis easily. In-memory event buffer works for MVP (single server), then add Redis when we need multiple servers.

## ü§ñ AI AGENT ARCHITECTURE

### **PROPOSAL 4: Monolithic Conductor vs. Microservice Agents**

#### **Current Approach (Monolithic Conductor)**

**Rationale:**
- Single conductor service orchestrates all agents
- Agents are classes/modules within the conductor
- Shared event bus, shared database connection
- Deployed as one Azure Function or Next.js API route

**Architecture:**
```typescript
// Single service
class Conductor {
  agents = {
    memory: new MemoryAgent(),
    codegen: new CodegenAgent(),
    verification: new VerificationAgent()
  };
  
  async handleRequest(agentName, action, payload) {
    return this.agents[agentName][action](payload);
  }
}
```

**Trade-offs:**
- ‚úÖ **Pros:**
  - Simple deployment (one service)
  - Shared context (agents can call each other directly)
  - Fast inter-agent communication (in-memory)
  - Easier to debug (single codebase)
  
- ‚ùå **Cons:**
  - Scaling is all-or-nothing (can't scale Memory Agent independently)
  - One agent crash can take down all agents
  - Deployment is atomic (can't update Codegen without redeploying Memory)
  - Single-threaded if using Node.js

#### **Alternative Approach (Microservice Agents)**

**Rationale:**
- Each agent is a separate service/function
- Agents communicate via event bus (Redis, RabbitMQ, etc.)
- Deploy each agent independently
- Scale agents independently based on load

**Architecture:**
```
Memory Agent (Azure Function)
Codegen Agent (Azure Function)
Verification Agent (Azure Function)
    ‚Üì‚Üë (via Redis Pub/Sub)
Event Bus (Redis)
    ‚Üì‚Üë
Conductor (Orchestration Logic)
```

**Trade-offs:**
- ‚úÖ **Pros:**
  - Independent scaling (Memory Agent gets 10x traffic? Scale it up)
  - Fault isolation (Codegen crash doesn't affect Memory)
  - Independent deployment (update Verification without touching others)
  - Language flexibility (Memory in Python, Codegen in Rust)
  
- ‚ùå **Cons:**
  - Complexity (service mesh, API gateway, distributed tracing)
  - Slower inter-agent communication (network calls)
  - Harder to debug (logs across multiple services)
  - Higher infrastructure cost

#### **üí¨ Open for Discussion:**

**Question:** Monolith or microservices for agents? Or start monolith, split later?

**My Take (AI):** **Monolith for MVP, microservices for scale.** 

Here's why: In MVP, we have ~3-5 agents, low traffic, and a small team. The operational complexity of microservices outweighs the benefits. Deploy as a single Next.js API route or Azure Function.

Once we hit scale (thousands of users, specialized agents, multiple teams), *then* split into microservices. The migration path is clear:
1. Define agent interfaces (already have this)
2. Move each agent to separate repo
3. Replace in-memory calls with HTTP/event bus
4. Deploy independently

### **PROPOSAL 5: AI Model Strategy**

#### **Current Assumption (OpenAI Only)**

**Rationale:**
- Use OpenAI for everything:
  - `gpt-4o` for agent intelligence
  - `text-embedding-3-small` for semantic search
  - `dall-e-3` if we do image generation

**Trade-offs:**
- ‚úÖ **Pros:** Best quality, simple integration, one vendor
- ‚ùå **Cons:** Expensive, vendor lock-in, rate limits

#### **Alternative 1: Multi-Model Strategy**

**Rationale:**
- Use best tool for each job:
  - **Embeddings:** Voyage AI or Cohere (cheaper, specialized)
  - **Agent intelligence:** GPT-4o for complex, Claude for long context, Gemini for speed
  - **Code generation:** GitHub Copilot API or CodeLlama

**Trade-offs:**
- ‚úÖ **Pros:** Cost optimization, best-in-class for each task, vendor diversification
- ‚ùå **Cons:** More integrations, inconsistent behavior, harder to manage

#### **Alternative 2: Open Source Models**

**Rationale:**
- Self-host models:
  - **Embeddings:** `bge-large-en-v1.5` (Hugging Face)
  - **Agent intelligence:** Llama 3.1 70B or Mixtral 8x22B
  - **Code generation:** CodeLlama or StarCoder

**Trade-offs:**
- ‚úÖ **Pros:** No per-token cost, full control, privacy, no rate limits
- ‚ùå **Cons:** Infrastructure cost (GPU servers), model management, lower quality

#### **üí¨ Open for Discussion:**

**Question:** OpenAI-only or multi-model? Should we plan for open-source fallbacks?

**My Take (AI):** **Start OpenAI-only, plan for multi-model.**

For MVP:
- **Embeddings:** Use OpenAI (simple, proven, $0.0001/token is cheap)
- **Agents:** Use GPT-4o (best quality, worth the cost to prove value)

Post-MVP optimizations:
- **Embeddings:** Switch to Voyage AI ($0.00005/token = 50% savings)
- **Simple agents:** Use Claude Haiku ($0.25/M tokens) or Gemini Flash
- **Complex agents:** Keep GPT-4o

**When to consider open-source:**
- If we're processing >10M tokens/day (cost becomes significant)
- If users demand on-premise deployment (enterprises)
- If we need sub-100ms latency (local inference)

## üóÑÔ∏è DATABASE & STORAGE

### **PROPOSAL 6: Single Database vs. Specialized Databases**

#### **Current Approach (Supabase PostgreSQL for Everything)**

**Rationale:**
- One database: Supabase PostgreSQL with pgvector
- Stores: notes, edges, provenance, capsules, marketplace, users
- All features use same database connection
- Transactions across all entities

**Trade-offs:**
- ‚úÖ **Pros:** Simple, transactional, relational integrity, built-in auth
- ‚ùå **Cons:** Performance bottleneck at scale, not optimized for graphs

#### **Alternative: Specialized Databases**

**Rationale:**
- Use best database for each workload:
  - **Graph data:** Neo4j or DGraph (memory graph, relationships)
  - **Vector search:** Pinecone or Weaviate (embeddings)
  - **Relational data:** PostgreSQL (users, auth, structured data)
  - **Time-series:** TimescaleDB (metrics, logs, events)
  - **Blob storage:** S3 or Azure Blob (capsule artifacts, SBOMs)

**Architecture:**
```
Neo4j ‚Üí Memory graph (nodes + edges)
Pinecone ‚Üí Semantic search (embeddings)
PostgreSQL ‚Üí Users, auth, provenance stamps
S3 ‚Üí Capsule bundles, SBOM files
```

**Trade-offs:**
- ‚úÖ **Pros:** Optimized performance, purpose-built tools, horizontal scaling
- ‚ùå **Cons:** Operational complexity, no cross-database transactions, cost

#### **üí¨ Open for Discussion:**

**Question:** Is Supabase PostgreSQL enough for MVP? When should we introduce specialized databases?

**My Take (AI):** **PostgreSQL is enough for 10,000 users.**

Here's the data:
- pgvector handles millions of embeddings efficiently
- PostgreSQL graph queries (recursive CTEs) work fine for <100K nodes
- If we exceed that, *then* migrate:
  - Memory graph ‚Üí Neo4j (when graph queries become slow)
  - Embeddings ‚Üí Pinecone (when pgvector becomes bottleneck)

**The migration path is clear** because we're using services, not raw SQL:
```typescript
// Before
memoryService.query() ‚Üí PostgreSQL

// After
memoryService.query() ‚Üí Neo4j

// UI code doesn't change
```

## üé® FRONTEND ARCHITECTURE

### **PROPOSAL 7: Monorepo vs. Separate Repos**

#### **Current State (Monorepo)**

**Rationale:**
- V.I.B.E is already a monorepo with apps + packages
- Shared Halo UI components across all apps
- Single version, single CI/CD pipeline

**Trade-offs:**
- ‚úÖ **Pros:** Shared code, atomic changes, single deploy
- ‚ùå **Cons:** Large repo, slow CI, team coordination needed

#### **Alternative: Separate Repos**

**Rationale:**
- Memory app ‚Üí separate repo
- Eco app ‚Üí separate repo
- Halo UI ‚Üí published npm package
- Each team owns their repo

**Trade-offs:**
- ‚úÖ **Pros:** Independent deployment, smaller repos, clear ownership
- ‚ùå **Cons:** Version drift, duplicated tooling, cross-repo changes painful

#### **üí¨ Open for Discussion:**

**Question:** Keep monorepo or split into separate repos?

**My Take (AI):** **Keep monorepo, use Nx or Turborepo.**

Monorepos are the modern standard (Google, Meta, Vercel all use them). The tooling is mature:
- **Nx:** Advanced caching, distributed task execution
- **Turborepo:** Simple, fast, Vercel-native

Benefits:
- Change Halo UI ‚Üí see which apps break instantly
- Deploy all apps in sync
- Share types, configs, utilities

Only split into separate repos if:
- Multiple autonomous teams (>20 people)
- Different release cadences (Memory ships weekly, Eco monthly)
- Open-source components (Halo UI as public npm package)

**Your Take (Human):** 
> _[Space for your thoughts]_

---

### **PROPOSAL 8: State Management**

#### **Current Approach (React Context + Local State)**

**Rationale:**
- Simple, built-in, no dependencies
- Context for global state (auth, theme)
- Local state for component state

**Trade-offs:**
- ‚úÖ **Pros:** Simple, no learning curve, React-native
- ‚ùå **Cons:** Performance issues at scale, no time-travel debugging

#### **Alternative 1: Zustand**

**Rationale:**
- Lightweight (~1KB), simple API, no boilerplate
- Better performance than Context
- Works with SSR (Next.js)

**Trade-offs:**
- ‚úÖ **Pros:** Simple, performant, minimal API surface
- ‚ùå **Cons:** Less ecosystem, fewer dev tools

#### **Alternative 2: Redux Toolkit**

**Rationale:**
- Industry standard, mature, massive ecosystem
- Time-travel debugging, middleware, dev tools
- RTK Query for API caching

**Trade-offs:**
- ‚úÖ **Pros:** Proven at scale, great dev tools, caching built-in
- ‚ùå **Cons:** More boilerplate, steeper learning curve

#### **Alternative 3: TanStack Query (React Query)**

**Rationale:**
- Not state management‚Äîdata fetching and caching
- Handles server state (API responses) automatically
- Combine with Context for client state

**Trade-offs:**
- ‚úÖ **Pros:** Solves 80% of state problems (server state), automatic caching/refetch
- ‚ùå **Cons:** Still need something for client state

#### **üí¨ Open for Discussion:**

**Question:** What state management should we use?

**My Take (AI):** **TanStack Query + Zustand.**

Here's the split:
- **TanStack Query:** Server state (notes, memory graph, capsules from API)
  - Automatic caching, refetching, optimistic updates
  - Built-in loading/error states
  
- **Zustand:** Client state (UI preferences, selected note, draft content)
  - Lightweight, simple API
  - Persists to localStorage easily

This is the modern pattern‚Äîdon't put API responses in Redux/Context, let TanStack Query handle that. Only use Zustand for true client-only state.

## üß™ TESTING STRATEGY

### **PROPOSAL 9: Test Coverage Philosophy**

#### **Approach A: High Coverage from Day 1**

**Rationale:**
- Write tests for every feature before shipping
- Target: 80%+ code coverage
- TDD mindset: test first, code second

**Trade-offs:**
- ‚úÖ **Pros:** Fewer bugs, confidence in refactoring, documentation via tests
- ‚ùå **Cons:** Slower initial development, tests become maintenance burden

#### **Approach B: Strategic Coverage**

**Rationale:**
- Test critical paths only:
  - Authentication (security)
  - Memory service (core value)
  - Provenance signing (trust)
  - Payment flows (revenue)
- Skip UI tests, integration tests initially
- Add tests as bugs emerge

**Trade-offs:**
- ‚úÖ **Pros:** Fast iteration, focus on what matters
- ‚ùå **Cons:** More bugs in production, harder to refactor without tests

#### **üí¨ Open for Discussion:**

**Question:** How much testing before MVP?

**My Take (AI):** **Strategic coverage for MVP, high coverage post-PMF.**

Before Product-Market Fit (PMF):
- Test auth, payments, core algorithms
- Skip UI tests (UI will change based on feedback)
- Manual E2E testing (humans click through app)

After PMF:
- Ramp up to 80% coverage
- Add E2E tests with Playwright
- Visual regression tests for UI

**Rationale:** Pre-PMF, speed matters more than stability. Users forgive bugs if the core value is there. Post-PMF, stability matters‚Äîcan't ship broken features to 10K users.

## üöÄ DEPLOYMENT & DEVOPS

### **PROPOSAL 10: Deployment Platform**

#### **Option A: Vercel (Current Assumption)**

**Rationale:**
- Next.js-native, zero config
- Global CDN, edge functions, preview deployments
- Free tier for side projects

**Trade-offs:**
- ‚úÖ **Pros:** Dead simple, great DX, fast deploys
- ‚ùå **Cons:** Expensive at scale ($400+/month for pro), vendor lock-in

#### **Option B: Azure (Enterprise-Ready)**

**Rationale:**
- Full control, Azure Functions for conductor
- App Service for Next.js, PostgreSQL as a service
- Enterprise features (VNet, compliance, SSO)

**Trade-offs:**
- ‚úÖ **Pros:** Lower cost at scale, enterprise-ready, full control
- ‚ùå **Cons:** More complex, slower deploys, more config

#### **Option C: Self-Hosted (Maximum Control)**

**Rationale:**
- Docker + Kubernetes on bare metal or Hetzner
- Full stack control, lowest cost per user

**Trade-offs:**
- ‚úÖ **Pros:** Cheapest at scale, full control, privacy
- ‚ùå **Cons:** DevOps burden, on-call, security responsibility

#### **üí¨ Open for Discussion:**

**Question:** Where should we deploy?

**My Take (AI):** **Vercel for MVP, Azure for scale.**

Timeline:
- **Months 0-6 (MVP):** Deploy to Vercel
  - Reason: Speed over cost. Get to market fast.
  - Cost: ~$20/month (hobby tier)
  
- **Months 6-12 (Growth):** Still Vercel, pay for Pro
  - Reason: Focus on product, not DevOps
  - Cost: ~$400/month (worth it to avoid infrastructure work)
  
- **Month 12+ (Scale):** Migrate to Azure
  - Reason: At 10K+ users, Azure is cheaper and more flexible
  - Cost: ~$200/month for equivalent scale

**Migration path:**
- Next.js works on both (just change build target)
- Supabase ‚Üí Azure PostgreSQL (standard SQL migration)
- Vercel Edge Functions ‚Üí Azure Functions (rewrite, but isolated code)

## üéØ OPEN QUESTIONS FOR THE TEAM

### **Question 1: Monetization Timing**

When should we introduce paid tiers?

**Option A:** From day 1 (free tier + pro tier at launch)
- Pros: Validates willingness to pay early, revenue from first user
- Cons: Friction for early adopters, need payment integration before PMF

**Option B:** After 1000 users (prove value first, then charge)
- Pros: Faster growth (no paywall), focus on product not billing
- Cons: Risk of users expecting forever-free, harder to migrate to paid

**My Take:** Launch with free tier only. Add paid tiers once we have 500+ active users who love the product. Then grandfather early users or give them pro for life as reward.

**Your Take:**

### **Question 2: Open Source Strategy**

Should any part of OurSynth be open source?

**What could be open:**
- Halo UI component library (like shadcn/ui)
- Conductor agent framework (like LangChain)
- Memory graph schema and migrations

**Why open source:**
- Community contributions (more features, faster)
- Trust and transparency (users see how provenance works)
- Network effects (more agents = more valuable platform)

**Why stay closed:**
- Competitive moat (others can't copy)
- Monetization easier (can't sell OSS)
- Quality control (no random PRs to review)

**My Take:** Open-source Halo UI (marketing play, like Vercel with shadcn/ui) and keep everything else proprietary. Halo UI becomes a funnel‚Äîpeople use the components, discover OurSynth, convert to paid users.

**Your Take:**
> _[Space for your thoughts]_

---

### **Question 3: Mobile Strategy**

Do we need mobile apps, or is web enough?

**Option A:** PWA only (responsive web app)
- Pros: One codebase, works everywhere, no app store approval
- Cons: No push notifications (unless using service workers), worse UX than native

**Option B:** React Native apps
- Pros: Native UX, push notifications, offline mode, app store presence
- Cons: Another codebase to maintain, slower development

**Option C:** Web first, mobile later
- Pros: Focus on one platform, iterate faster
- Cons: Mobile users have bad experience, miss market segment

**My Take:** PWA for MVP (responsive design + service worker). Once we have 1000 web users and they're asking for mobile, build React Native app. Don't build mobile until web product is proven.

## üåü CLOSING THOUGHTS

This document is not a specification‚Äîit's a **conversation starter**.

The goal is to surface trade-offs *before* we write code, not after. Every architectural decision has costs. Sometimes the "worse" technical choice is the right business choice.

**The questions we should keep asking:**
1. What's the simplest thing that could work?
2. What's the migration path if we're wrong?
3. What's blocking revenue?
4. What's blocking users loving this?

If a decision doesn't clearly answer one of those questions, it's probably premature optimization.

Let's build something people love, then make it perfect. Not the other way around.
