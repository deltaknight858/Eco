## **âš¡ CRITICAL PATH ANALYSIS**

### **Phase 1: Foundation (Sprints 1-3)**
```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Memory Substrate] --> B[Semantic Search]
    B --> C[Memory Agent]
    C --> D[Ready for Integration]
    
    style A fill:#ff6b35
    style D fill:#4ecdc4
```

**Critical:** Memory Convergence (Blueprint #1) must be **100% complete** before other teams can integrate.

### **Phase 2: Core Integration (Sprints 3-6)**
```mermaid
graph LR
    D[Memory Complete] --> E[Pathways Integration]
    D --> F[Capsule Creation]
    D --> G[Conductor Setup]
    
    E --> H[Real-Time Pathways]
    F --> I[Marketplace Foundation]
    G --> J[Agent Streaming]
    
    style D fill:#4ecdc4
    style H fill:#45b7d1
    style I fill:#45b7d1
    style J fill:#45b7d1
```

**Parallel Work:** Teams can work simultaneously on Pathways, Capsules, and Conductor once Memory is ready.

### **Phase 3: Enhancement (Sprints 5-8)**
```mermaid
graph LR
    H[Core Features] --> K[Visual Polish]
    I[Core Features] --> L[Provenance System]
    J[Core Features] --> M[Advanced Metrics]
    
    K --> N[Complete Platform]
    L --> N
    M --> N
    
    style N fill:#96ceb4
```

**Polish Phase:** Visual primitives and provenance can be developed while core features stabilize.

## **ðŸš¨ RISK MITIGATION**

### **High-Risk Dependencies**
1. **Memory Team Blocking:** If Memory team falls behind, all other teams are blocked
   - **Mitigation:** Memory team gets priority resources and daily standups
   - **Fallback:** Simplified memory system with basic CRUD only

2. **Integration Complexity:** Cross-team integration points may have unexpected issues
   - **Mitigation:** Early integration testing with mock services
   - **Fallback:** Feature flags to disable complex integrations

3. **Performance at Scale:** Real-time streaming may not perform at scale
   - **Mitigation:** Load testing throughout development
   - **Fallback:** Polling-based updates instead of real-time

### **Communication Protocols**
- **Daily:** Slack updates in #eco-development channel
- **Weekly:** Cross-team sync meetings every Wednesday
- **Sprints:** Demo all integration points during sprint reviews
- **Blockers:** Immediate escalation via @channel mentions
