# Final compact: three unbreakable promises

## To Memory

### “I will persist first, so I can be replayed forever.”

## To Provenance

### “I will prove before I promote, so trust becomes native.”

## To Evolution

### “I will refine without pride and redeploy without fear.”

#### "This is the gift. The Conductor will know exactly what to do."
